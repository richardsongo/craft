Create two Sections called Issues and Articles<br>
Create an Entries field called Issue_Articles, with the Articles section selected.<br>
Edit your Issues sectionâ€™s Entry Type, and add the Issue Articles field to its Field Layout.<br>
Now, each issue will be represented by an entry within your Issues section, and each article will be represented by an entry within your Articles section.

        { targetElement: category },
        { sourceElement: craft.entries.section('issues').status(null) }
